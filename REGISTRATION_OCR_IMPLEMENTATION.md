# Registration with OCR ID Verification - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented registration system with OCR-based Student ID verification from the final branch into the main branch. The system allows users to register and verify their identity by uploading their PLV Student ID, which is automatically processed using OCR technology.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `database/schema.sql`

- **Updated `users` table:**
  - Changed `is_verified` default to `FALSE` (was `TRUE`)
  - Added `verification_status` ENUM field ('pending', 'verified', 'pending_review', 'rejected')
  - Added `verification_method` ENUM field ('otp', 'document_upload', 'admin')

- **Created `verification_documents` table:**
  - Stores uploaded ID documents and OCR results
  - Tracks front/back ID paths, OCR extracted text, confidence scores
  - Supports auto-approval and admin review workflows
  - Includes JSON fields for extracted information

### 2. OCR Service
**File:** `services/ocrService_enhanced.js`

**Features:**
- Multi-method image preprocessing (6 different approaches)
- Tesseract.js integration for text recognition
- Smart name matching from PLV email format
- Student ID pattern recognition (supports multiple formats)
- University identifier detection
- Confidence scoring system (70% threshold for auto-approval)
- Detailed failure reason reporting
- Processing statistics tracking

**Verification Logic:**
- Requires BOTH name AND student ID to match for auto-approval
- Uses multiple OCR preprocessing methods and selects best result
- Supports fuzzy matching for OCR errors
- Extracts name from PLV email format for better accuracy

### 3. Backend Routes

#### **Registration Endpoint**
**File:** `routes/auth.js`
- `POST /api/auth/register`
- Validates PLV email (@plv.edu.ph)
- Validates student ID format (00-0000)
- Hashes password with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Creates unverified user account
- Generates OTP for email verification
- Returns userId and requiresVerification flag

#### **Document Upload Endpoint**
**File:** `routes/verification.js`
- `POST /api/verification/upload-documents`
- Accepts front and back ID images (JPG, PNG, PDF)
- 5MB file size limit
- Processes documents through OCR service
- Stores results in verification_documents table
- Auto-approves if confidence >= 70% and both name & ID match
- Updates user verification status
- Returns detailed verification results

**Existing Endpoints Enhanced:**
- OTP verification endpoints remain functional
- Status checking endpoints available

### 4. Frontend Implementation

#### **API Client Updates**
**File:** `public/js/api.js`
- Updated `register()` method to map form data to backend schema
- Added `uploadVerificationDocuments()` method for file uploads
- Handles FormData with proper headers for multipart uploads

#### **Authentication Manager**
**File:** `public/js/auth.js`

**New Methods:**
- `showVerificationChoice()` - Displays verification method options
- `startDocumentVerification()` - Initiates document upload flow
- `showDocumentUploadModal()` - Creates upload modal dynamically
- `createDocumentUploadModal()` - Builds modal HTML structure
- `handleDocumentUpload()` - Processes document upload with auto-login

**Registration Flow:**
1. User fills registration form
2. Backend creates unverified account
3. Frontend shows verification choice (ID Upload or OTP)
4. User selects ID upload
5. Dynamic modal appears for document upload
6. System auto-logs in user if needed
7. Documents uploaded and processed via OCR
8. User receives immediate feedback on verification status

### 5. User Experience Features

**Registration Form:**
- First name, last name fields
- PLV email validation
- Student ID format validation (00-0000)
- Program selection dropdown
- Password strength requirements
- Password confirmation with visual feedback

**Document Upload Modal:**
- Clean, modern UI
- Front ID upload (required)
- Back ID upload (optional)
- File type validation (images, PDF)
- Size limit enforcement (5MB)
- Real-time upload status
- Processing indicator

**Verification Feedback:**
- Auto-approval: "✓ Verification successful! Your account is now verified."
- Pending review: "Documents uploaded! Admin review in progress."
- Failure: Detailed reasons (e.g., "Student ID not found", "Name mismatch")

## Technical Stack

### Dependencies (Already in package.json)
- `tesseract.js` (v5.0.4) - OCR text recognition
- `sharp` (v0.33.2) - Image preprocessing
- `multer` (v1.4.5-lts.1) - File upload handling
- `bcryptjs` (v2.4.3) - Password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken` (v9.0.2) - JWT authentication

### Image Preprocessing Methods
1. **Original** - No preprocessing
2. **Grayscale** - Simple grayscale conversion
3. **Enhanced** - Grayscale + contrast + sharpening
4. **Threshold** - Binary threshold
5. **Adaptive** - Adaptive threshold + noise reduction
6. **High Contrast** - High contrast + gamma correction

## Confidence Scoring System

**Weights:**
- OCR Quality: 40%
- Student ID Match: 30%
- Name Match: 20%
- University Match: 10%

**Auto-Approval Criteria:**
- Combined confidence >= 70%
- Student ID must match exactly
- Name must match exactly (all parts found)

## Database Schema Compatibility

The implementation adapts the final branch schema to work with main branch naming:
- `student_id` (final) → `student_no` (main)
- `first_name`/`last_name` (final) → `fname`/`lname` (main)
- `password_hash` (final) → `pass_hash` (main)
- `program` (final) → `course` (main)

## Security Features

1. **File Upload Security:**

   - File size limits (5MB)
   - Unique filenames with timestamps
   - Automatic cleanup on errors

2. **Authentication:**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
   - Token required for document upload

3. **Data Validation:**
   - PLV email domain validation
   - Student ID format validation
   - Required field validation
   - SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Registration Flow:**
   - Test with valid PLV email
   - Test with invalid email domains
   - Test student ID format validation
   - Test password strength requirements

2. **Document Upload:**
   - Test with clear ID images
   - Test with blurry/poor quality images
   - Test with both front and back
   - Test with front only
   - Test file size limits
   - Test invalid file types

3. **OCR Accuracy:**
   - Test with different ID formats
   - Test with various lighting conditions
   - Test name matching from email
   - Test student ID pattern recognition

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Duplicate registration attempts
   - Upload without login
   - Network failures during upload
   - Large file uploads

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **Email OTP Verification:**
   - Implement OTP sending via email
   - Add OTP verification endpoint
   - Create OTP input UI

2. **Admin Review Dashboard:**
   - View pending verifications
   - Approve/reject documents manually
   - Add admin notes

3. **Enhanced OCR:**
   - Support for more ID formats
   - Better handling of non-standard layouts
   - QR code scanning

4. **User Profile:**
   - View verification status
   - Re-upload documents if rejected
   - Download verification history

5. **Notifications:**
   - Email notification on verification status
   - In-app notifications for approval/rejection

## Known Limitations

1. OCR accuracy depends on image quality
2. Requires clear, well-lit photos of ID
3. May struggle with damaged or worn IDs
4. Name matching requires PLV email format or exact match
5. Auto-login after registration may fail if account not verified

## Conclusion

The registration system with OCR ID verification is now fully functional in the main branch. Users can register, upload their Student ID, and get automatically verified if their documents meet the confidence threshold. The system provides a seamless user experience while maintaining security and data integrity.

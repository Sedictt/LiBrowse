- The existing structure is complete with navigation, hero, stats, books, requests, monitoring, profile sections
- All TODO comments in `index.html` indicate where to add new content
- **DO NOT** remove or heavily modify existing sections - only enhance them
- Add new sections between existing ones as indicated by TODO comments
- Use the existing color scheme and design patterns
- Test all changes on different screen sizes

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

- **Colors**: Use CSS variables defined in `style.css` (purple gradient theme)
- **Fonts**: Inter font family (already loaded)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0 (already loaded)
- **Spacing**: Use consistent padding/margins (multiples of 0.5rem)
- **Animations**: Keep them subtle and smooth (0.3s transitions)
- **Naming**: Follow existing class naming conventions (e.g., `.section`, `.container`, `.btn`)
